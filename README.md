# Project Martini: Additional helpdesk and central management feature for Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365

Project Martini adds an extra layer on top of existing Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 installations. This can be used as a helpdesk and central management solution.

It allows the following features:

- Create tenants/GEO based locations
- Deploy Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 in AWS via Terraform
- Manage 1 or more Veeam Backup for Microsoft Office 365 installations
- A web interface which provides central management and self-service restore capabilities
- A command line for automation and initial setup
- An API for integration with 3rd party solutions

## üìó Documentation

### Requirements

- Linux VM (Ubuntu/Debian are fully tested and supported)

### Installation

Project Martini can be installed by leveraging the CLI as explained in [The installation blog](http://blog.dewin.me/2019/06/installing-project-martini.html)

### Configuration

Follow the setup via the CLI.

### Usage

Open a webbrowser and go to index.php. From here you can either login as an admin or a tenant.

### Dependencies for the web interface

Make sure you download dependencies using `composer`.

For more information on how to install `composer`:

- Windows (https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-windows)

This project leverages a mixture HTML, PHP and Javascript. The following libraries are used:

- [Flatpickr.js](http://flatpickr.js.org/)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.com/)
- [GuzzleHTTP](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io)
- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)

It is required to have a webserver running with PHP5 or higher and the mod_rewrite module enabled. The easiest way to do this is leverage a Linux VM with Apache2.

As an example you can use the following [Linux Ubuntu with Apache guide](https://www.linode.com/docs/web-servers/lamp/install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04).

This portal leverages rewrite rules via .htaccess and therefor mod_rewrite needs to be enabled in Apache. More information on this can be found via [Enabling mod_rewrite for Apache running on Linux Ubuntu](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-rewrite-urls-with-mod_rewrite-for-apache-on-ubuntu-16-04).

#### Important step

Disable MultiView within the directory document root for Apache. This can be done my modifying the default site configuration and set it as below:

```text
<Directory /var/www/html>
        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
</Directory>
```

**It is advised to increase or disable the PHP maximum execution time limit.** This can modified in the php.ini file as described per [changing the maximum execution time limit](https://www.simplified.guide/php/increase-max-execution-time)
